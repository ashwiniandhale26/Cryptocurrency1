            <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption
                algorithms.<br> The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a
                currency
                and as a virtual accounting system. To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These
                wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or on your mobile
                device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity
                and link to your cryptocurrency.

            <h2>Bitcoin</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.
                Transactions are made with no middle men â€“ meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on
                Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich
                by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.
